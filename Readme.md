# Arquillian "Getting Started" Guide using gradle instead of maven
since it is not straight forward to translate the pom.xml presented in http://arquillian.org/guides/getting_started/ to gradle, i made this minimal demo project, to demonstrate how the "Getting Started" can be done with gradle instead or using maven

Moreover it turned out, that even the pom.xml from the tutorial "Getting Started" does also NOT really work out of the box, mostly since the version numbers used a quite outdated. Even this:  https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-examples/tree/master/arquillian-tutorial  did not really work for me.
